# Integration Master
Integration Master is an easy, poewerfull, and open-source project getting build entirely in Java. It's aim is to serve as a powerful data integration tool, facilitating seamless integration between two systems through data manipulation using Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) techniques. It supports various data sources such as CSV, Excel, XML, REST API, and databases, and can generate output in any of these formats as well.

## Features
 - Flexible Data Integration: Integration Master provides a flexible and extensible framework for integrating data from diverse sources. It allows you to extract data from multiple formats and systems, transform it according to your specific requirements, and load it into the desired destination.
 - Multiple Data Source Support: With Integration Master, you can easily import data from CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, XML files, REST APIs, and databases. It provides built-in connectors and adapters for seamless integration with these data sources, making it convenient to work with different types of data.
 - Data Transformation and Manipulation: Integration Master offers a wide range of data transformation capabilities. You can apply complex data manipulation operations, such as filtering, sorting, aggregating, joining, and mapping, to transform your data and align it with the target system's requirements.
 - Customizable Integration Pipelines: The project provides a flexible pipeline-based approach to define and execute integration workflows. You can create custom integration pipelines by chaining together various data processing tasks and transformations to suit your specific integration needs.
 - Output Flexibility: Integration Master allows you to write the integrated data to multiple output formats, including CSV, Excel, XML, REST API endpoints, and databases. This ensures compatibility and seamless integration with the target system, regardless of its data format requirements.
